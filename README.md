##Introduction
This project has been developed as a part of the INFO90010 Technology Innovation unit. It's purpose is to demonstrate a basic prototype of the innovation solution developed throughout the semester.

##Components
###Backend
The backend directory contains the interfaces for a  mock implementation of the [NationalCrimeCheck API](https://www.nationalcrimecheck.com.au/api_docs/consumer_v1). These interfaces have been used to simulate the requests and responses of the [Checks API](https://www.nationalcrimecheck.com.au/api_docs/consumer_v1/endpoints/checks/create_check).
###Frontend
The frontend consists of a basic angular web app which has been forked from the [Angular Material Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/flatlogic/angular-material-admin) project.  Data storage, user authentication, and API integration have been mocked using in memory services.
